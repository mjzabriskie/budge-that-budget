## Description

This web app is a PWA that can be installed on a device. It is a budget tracker that will allow a user to add funds or subtract funds, and shows the total cash amount over time as represented by a graph below. The app can accept input while offline, and as soon as a connection is reestablished, it will notify the user that any transactions they completed while offline were uploaded to the server/database.
